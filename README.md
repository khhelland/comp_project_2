comp_project_2
==============
These are the source files for project 2 in FYS3150 at UIO.
The file jacobi.cpp contains functions for diagonalising
a real diagonal matrix with the Jacobi method. matrixfuncitons.cpp
contains functions for filling in a matrix and fetching potentials.
plotter.py compiles 2_c.cpp, runs it several times and saves an image to
file. 2_c.cpp and 2_program.cpp both construct a matrix and diagonalize it
by the Jacobi method.
